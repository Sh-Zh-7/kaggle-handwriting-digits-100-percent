# kaggle-handwriting-digits-100-percent
Handwrting digits recognizing is a good getting-started competition for the beginner of CNN.<br>
However, many competitors get 100% accuracy in this competition, which is impossible for many situations in the reality.<br>
How did they get that? Actually, It's the **overfitting** problems.<br>
The only way to do that is to **download the whole minst data set,** and match every sample with the origin data.<br>
This repo is going to make that with KNN algorithm.

**Warning**: This repo is only for figuring out how to get 100% percent accuarcy in kaggle handwriting digits recoginzing competition.<br>
The method I used isn't for the actual project. It's incorrect. When you are doing other platforms' competitions and other projects that will apply in the reality, avoiding using that.<br>
